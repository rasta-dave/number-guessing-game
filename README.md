# 🎮 Rust Number Guessing Game

A very basic, but colorful and interactive command-line number guessing game written in Rust. This project was created as part of my journey learning Rust programming language, featuring an engaging interface with color feedback and a temperature-based hint system.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 Guess numbers between 1-100
- 🎨 Colorful interface with intuitive feedback
- 🌡️ Hot/Cold hint system to guide your guesses
- 🏆 High score tracking
- 3️⃣ Three attempts per game
- ✅ Input validation and error handling
- 🔄 Option to play multiple rounds
- 💻 Written in idiomatic Rust

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Dependencies:
  - `rand` - For random number generation
  - `colored` - For colorful terminal output

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

### Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-guessing-game
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd rust-guessing-game
```

Build the project:

```bash
cargo build
```

Run the game:

```bash
cargo run
```

## 🎮 How to Play

- Launch the game using cargo run
- You'll have 3 attempts to guess a number between 1 and 100

  - After each guess, you'll receive:

  - 🔵 Indication if your guess is too high or too low
  - 🌡️ A "Hot/Cold" hint comparing to your previous guess
  - 🎯 Your remaining attempts

Try to guess the number with as few attempts as possible to get a high score!

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
